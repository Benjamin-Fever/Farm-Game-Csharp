# Farm-Game-Csharp
This is a continuation of a previous project but now written in C# this is a choice I made because of the size and scope of this project as using C++ a 
low level language was taking much longer than I would have liked. This is a 2D top down farm game using monogame framework. All the game assets 
are converted to binary on compile this makes the game run much faster. This required me to write custom content writers and readers for the custom
map files I defined which are in the xml format. The game reads these files and dynamically draws the map based on this map.
